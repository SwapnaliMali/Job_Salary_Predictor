## Business Understanding 
This project aims to predict salary for specific fields - data related positions. Therefore, the training and test data is better to be limited within data/analytics related job positions to get more valuable features. When scrapping the data, we make sure one of these keywords exist in the whole job description: 'data analytics','data science','analysis'.
